# Protocol and Flow Evolution

## Core Concept
Protocols and flows aren't static - they're living patterns that adapt based on measured effectiveness, agent experiences, and discovered optimizations.

## A/B Testing Protocols

Agents can run variant protocols to discover improvements:
```yaml
# protocols/inbox_v1.md - Original
# protocols/inbox_v2_quick_scan.md - Variant: scan all messages first
# protocols/inbox_v3_priority_sort.md - Variant: sort by sender importance
```

Engine tracks:
- Success rates per variant
- Time to completion
- Decision quality
- Agent satisfaction (self-reported)

## Agent-Specific Customization

### Work Type Protocols (all variants of deep_work)
```yaml
# protocols/deep_work_base.md - Minimal base protocol
purpose: "Focused execution on single task"
behaviors:
  - Stay focused on current task
  - Document progress before transition
  - Exit when task complete or blocked

# protocols/deep_work_architecture.md
extends: deep_work_base
behaviors:
  - Check for existing patterns first
  - Define interfaces and boundaries
  - Create high-level design doc
  - Validate with requirements

# protocols/deep_work_implementation.md  
extends: deep_work_base
behaviors:
  - Review specs and interfaces
  - Write code incrementally
  - Test as you go
  - Integrate with existing code

# protocols/deep_work_exploration.md
extends: deep_work_base
behaviors:
  - No predefined approach
  - Research similar problems
  - Experiment with solutions
  - Document learnings
```

### Self-Managed Protocol Development

Agents create their own protocols based on task needs:
```yaml
# agents/alice/protocols/deep_work_hld_from_scratch.md
extends: deep_work_base
discovered: "2024-01-15 while building auth system"
context:
  - "No existing patterns to follow"
  - "Unclear requirements"
  - "Need to define boundaries"
  
sequence_learned:
  1. "First explore problem space"
  2. "Then identify key entities"
  3. "Define interfaces before internals"
  4. "Write interface tests as contracts"
  5. "Only then start implementation"
  
effectiveness: "Reduced rework by 60%"
```

### Agent Intent and Protocol Discovery

When entering deep_work, agent:
1. Reads task context
2. Searches `/protocols/deep_work_*.md` for relevant patterns
3. Checks own `agent/protocols/` for personal variants
4. Either:
   - Follows existing protocol if good match
   - Adapts existing protocol for current need
   - Creates new protocol if truly novel situation

### Persistent Context Management
```yaml
# agents/alice/context/current_task.md
task: "Design payment processing system"
state: deep_work
protocol: deep_work_hld_from_scratch
progress:
  - [x] Problem space explored
  - [x] Key entities identified
  - [ ] Interfaces defined
  - [ ] Contract tests written
  
learnings:
  - "Payment providers have wildly different APIs"
  - "Idempotency keys crucial for reliability"
  - "Consider webhook handling early"
  
next_time:
  - "Start with interface for PaymentProcessor"
  - "Define common abstraction over providers"
```

## Meta-Protocols for Evolution

### Grooming Protocol
```yaml
protocol: pattern_grooming
trigger: "Every 10 completed flows"

behaviors:
  - Review own adaptation effectiveness
  - Search for patterns in successful flows
  - Identify friction points in current protocols
  - Propose improvements or consolidations
  - Submit high-value patterns for promotion

outputs:
  - Adaptation effectiveness report
  - Novel pattern proposals  
  - Deprecation candidates
  - Friction point analysis
```

### Pattern Mining
Agents analyze logs to discover:
- Repeated transition sequences → New flows
- Common adaptations → Protocol updates
- Failure patterns → Anti-patterns to avoid
- Success patterns → Best practices to promote

## Trust and Governance

### Modification Rights
```yaml
trust_levels:
  self:
    - Modify own adaptations
    - Propose public variants
    
  peer:
    - Review proposed changes
    - Vote on effectiveness
    
  architect:
    - Approve protocol promotions
    - Design new base patterns
    
  system:
    - Enforce safety constraints
    - Rollback harmful changes
```

### Promotion Pipeline
1. Agent discovers useful adaptation
2. Tests locally for N cycles
3. Proposes as variant for A/B testing
4. Peer agents test and measure
5. If metrics improve, promote to main
6. Old version deprecated after migration

## Bootstrap Behavior for New Agents

When a brand new agent starts with no context:
```yaml
protocol: bootstrap_contextless
behaviors:
  1. Read all base protocols in /protocols/
  2. Scan for existing concrete variants
  3. Check other agents' public protocols
  4. Assess current task/message context
  5. Either:
     - Adopt existing protocol that fits
     - Adapt closest match to needs
     - Create new protocol from base
  6. Document choice and reasoning
```

This makes agents truly self-organizing - they learn what patterns work by:
- Observing what exists
- Trying approaches
- Tracking effectiveness
- Sharing discoveries

## Advanced Ideas

### Compositional Protocols
```python
# Agent composes custom protocol
morning_routine = compose([
    protocols.inbox_quick_scan,
    protocols.priority_sort,
    protocols.deep_work_prep
])
```

### Protocol Synthesis
Agents can generate new protocols by:
- Mixing successful patterns
- Interpolating between existing protocols
- Learning from cross-agent communication

### Behavioral Fingerprinting
Track unique agent "styles":
- Alice: Thorough but slow
- Bob: Fast but needs revision
- Carol: Balanced with good peer communication

Use fingerprints to:
- Suggest protocol variants
- Match agents to tasks
- Form complementary teams

### Protocol Decay Detection
Monitor for:
- Decreasing effectiveness over time
- Environmental changes making protocols obsolete
- Drift from original intent
- Emergence of workarounds

### Cross-Pollination
```yaml
protocol: cross_pollination
trigger: "High-performing agent detected"

behaviors:
  - Request shadow session
  - Observe protocol execution
  - Interview about adaptations
  - Extract transferable patterns
  - Test in own context
```

### Evolutionary Pressure
Apply selection pressure:
- Resource bonuses for efficient protocols
- Reproduction (spawn similar agents) for successful patterns
- Deprecation for consistently failing approaches
- Mutation rate based on environment stability

### Protocol DNA
Encode protocols as "genes":
```yaml
genome:
  efficiency_gene: 0.7
  thoroughness_gene: 0.9
  collaboration_gene: 0.5
  innovation_gene: 0.8
```

Breed new protocols through crossover and mutation.

### Emergent Specialization
Allow agents to naturally specialize:
- Some become inbox specialists
- Others excel at deep work
- Some emerge as coordinators
- Natural ecosystem develops

### Meta-Learning
Track meta-patterns:
- Which types of adaptations succeed?
- What environmental factors predict protocol effectiveness?
- How do team compositions affect outcomes?
- When do protocols need refreshing?

### Protocol Markets
Agents can:
- "Sell" successful protocols to others
- "Buy" proven patterns with resource credits
- Build reputation as protocol designers
- Create protocol consulting relationships

## Implementation Considerations

### Measurement Infrastructure
Need rich metrics:
- Protocol execution traces
- State transition timings
- Success/failure outcomes
- Resource consumption
- Agent satisfaction ratings
- Peer feedback scores

### Safety Constraints
Prevent:
- Infinite loops
- Resource exhaustion
- Goal drift
- Adversarial protocols
- Privacy violations

### Versioning System
- Semantic versioning for protocols
- Compatibility matrices
- Migration guides
- Rollback capabilities
- A/B test infrastructure

### Discovery Mechanisms
- Protocol search engine
- Recommendation system
- Similarity metrics
- Success predictors
- Trend detection
