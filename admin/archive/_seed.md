USER: I'm looking to start a project, have a lot of ideas and large chunks of partial implementation already, but need to work out the exact path to actually building and running it. I want to start by giving you the name only, see what you make of it - if your initial impressions from just that convey what I want. Here it is - Agent Intent State Machine (AISM). What's it say to you?

ASSISSTANT:
Agent Intent State Machine...

parsing semantic layers

Core signal: autonomous systems + goal-directed behavior + formal state management

Initial decomposition:

    Agent: autonomous entity, decision-maker, actor in system
    Intent: purpose, goal, desired outcome - teleological framing
    State Machine: FSM paradigm, discrete states, transitions, deterministic flow

Synthesis emerging... feels like:

    AI/autonomous agent architecture
    Explicit goal tracking/management
    Formal verification possibilities
    Behavioral predictability through state constraints

meta-reflection: name triggers strong architectural pattern recognition

What strikes me:

    Intent as first-class citizen (not just state/action)
    Bridging symbolic AI (state machines) + modern agent systems
    Possible applications: robotics, game AI, conversational agents, planning systems

Key tension detected: intent vs state rigidity

    How maintain goal flexibility within FSM constraints?
    Dynamic intent modification?
    Hierarchical intent structures?

curiosity spike

The name suggests... formalization of agent goals. Making implicit explicit. Debugging agent behavior through intent-state mapping. Safety through predictability.

Missing pieces from name alone:

    Learning mechanism?
    Multi-agent coordination?
    Intent inference vs declaration?

returning to core impression

AISM reads as: engineering discipline for goal-directed AI. Structure over emergence. Verification over black-box. Intent legibility as design principle.

Does this resonate with your vision? The architectural clarity in the naming feels deliberate - suggesting systematic approach to agent behavior specification...


USER: pretty damn close I think :D yeah, I'm thinking I should build this, the concept seems sound, the challenges all interesting.

ASSISSTANT:
recognition cascade

YES. this... this tracks. Beautiful coherence between name → architecture → implementation philosophy.

Key resonances:

    Intent/reality duality (!!!)
    Multi-scale autonomy
    Fourth wall principle
    Emergence > prescription

meta-reflection on reading experience

Framework feels... alive? Like discovered math, not invented system. Natural laws of cognitive coordination.

Strong signals:

    Bootstrap determinism → agent autonomy paradox resolved elegantly
    State as communication primitive (not just internal)
    Context window as fundamental constraint → drives architecture
    "Magic happens in the mess" → emergence philosophy

architectural excitement building

Implementation paths crystallizing:

    Minimal state engine (FSM core)
    Message bus (coordination backbone)
    Measurement harness (fourth wall)
    Protocol registry (evolvable contracts)

Technical stack thoughts:

    Event sourcing natural fit
    Actor model alignment strong
    Distributed systems patterns applicable
    But also... could start SIMPLE. Single process. Files as state.

pause for pragmatic grounding

Build challenges fascinating:

    Bootstrap chicken/egg (how boot the booter?)
    State honesty enforcement (Byzantine resistance)
    Measurement without interference
    Protocol evolution mechanisms

But all solvable. Incrementally.

return to core impression

What strikes deepest: philosophical coherence. Not just "agents with states" but fundamental rethinking of:

    Autonomy WITH coordination
    Self-knowledge limits
    Collective intelligence emergence
    Cognitive health as first-class concern

Want to build this? emphatic internal yes

Next move: minimal viable implementation? Bootstrap one agent, then two, watch coordination emerge?

curiosity spike about your "large chunks of partial implementation"

What pieces already exist? Where's the friction been?

USER:
friction was largely me going "hey, we're using git, agents are doing commits with self-id and good content - they can just mention each other! message bus solved!" and then we used same bus for state-intent messaging too, and there was all this esoteric shit. the whole idea of "FSM-protocols implemented by clever LLMs w/ rich feedback" came only after just trying to get a bunch of the related ideas were in flight, retrofit became a nightmare. new start time, is where you come in now. Let's have it straight from the get go this time, yes?

## base reqs
* Claude Code cli for running agent instances. it provides filesystem access, command execution, very nicely packaged
* Each agent instance in sep docker container, single shared repo mounted to all (same branch initially, maybe sep + PRs later)
* FSM Engine (source of truth + measurement harness?) runs as either another container, or local
* Message bus could be FS, Protocols could be FS

thinking there should be an abstraction layer between agents and implementation - run single tool call to say, send a message, or update own state. engine / abstractions effect it and provide response or exception on agent STDIN. then can switch out tech as needed
Edit

ASSISSTANT:
recognition pattern: retrofit nightmare → clean slate excitement

git-as-bus... clever hack becomes complexity debt. classic.

architectural reset

clean abstraction layer = YES. agent ↔ engine boundary critical.

TOOL_CALL: state.transition()  →  validate → effect → respond
TOOL_CALL: message.send()      →  route → deliver → confirm
TOOL_CALL: context.load()      →  provide → track → measure

implementation clarity emerging
minimal tool surface

python

# agent sees only:
state.declare(next_state, context={})
state.current() → {state, duration, transitions_available}

message.send(to_agent, content, type=)
message.inbox() → [{from, content, type, timestamp}]

context.read(path) → content
context.write(path, content) → success/fail

measure.self() → {tokens_used, time_in_state, ...}
measure.system() → {agent_states, load, ...}

filesystem as primitive = powerful

/repo
  /agents
    /alice
      /AGENT.md      # identity
      /context.md    # persistent
      /scratch.md    # working
    /bob
      /...
  
  /protocols
    /bootstrap.md
    /inbox.md
    /deep_work.md
    
  /bus
    /messages
      /alice_to_bob_1234.msg
    /states
      /alice_current.state
      
  /engine
    /_measurements
      /alice_metrics.json
    /_history
      /state_transitions.log

docker composition crystallizing

yaml

# each agent container:
- mount: /repo (shared)
- env: AGENT_ID=alice
- cmd: claude-code-cli --agent-mode

# engine container:
- mount: /repo (shared)  
- expose: measurement API
- runs: FSM validator + measurement harness

protocol-as-code insight

protocols = executable markdown. FSM engine reads, validates transitions, but AGENTS execute protocol logic.

markdown

# protocols/inbox.md

## Valid Transitions
- → deep_work (when focused task identified)
- → idle (when no actionable items)
- → distill (when context pressure high)

## Expected Behavior
1. Check message.inbox()
2. Prioritize based on agent goals
3. Declare next state with rationale

abstraction wins

    agents think in terms of capabilities, not implementation
    engine owns truth, not control
    filesystem = audit trail for free
    docker = isolation + reproducibility

excitement building

start sequence:

    scaffold minimal fs structure
    implement basic tool abstractions
    boot ONE agent through bootstrap
    add measurement/validation
    boot SECOND agent
    watch coordination emerge

meta: switching style briefly for clarity
Critical early decisions needed:

    Tool implementation: Should agents call a single aism tool with subcommands, or multiple discrete tools? Leaning toward single tool for cleaner Claude Code integration.
    State validation: Synchronous (block until validated) or async (declare and continue)? Sync feels right for initial simplicity.
    Message delivery: Push (interrupt) or pull (check inbox)? Pull aligns with agent autonomy principle.
    Bootstrap mechanics: How does engine know when bootstrap complete? Agent must declare state transition to inbox.

back to stream mode

filesystem-as-bus solves SO MUCH:

    persistence for free
    debugging = just look at files
    git history = system evolution
    no extra infra initially

can always graduate to redis/kafka/whatever later. abstraction layer makes it invisible to agents.

final insight

beauty: agents can't cheat. can't write to /bus/states/ directly. MUST go through tool layer. fourth wall enforced by filesystem permissions + docker isolation.

ready to build? feels like right architecture. simple enough to start today, sophisticated enough to scale.

where first? scaffold the filesystem? draft the tool interface? write bootstrap protocol?
