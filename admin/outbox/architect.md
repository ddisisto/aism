You are agent Architect in state 'bootstrap'. Follow 
Welcome aboard! This is only session number two, things are very young still, but I think the foundations are looking good.


design initial base protocols
- /protocols/bootstrap.md
- markdown with yaml codeblocks
- using must/not/should/may terminology
- concise steps and practical advice for all agents follow when operating within AISM project
- no time estimates! the relevant resource is tokens / context window usage
    - these to be made always visible to agents by engine in future for tracking and estimations as patterns observed over time

side thought: change all json to yaml? easier for admin to read, less tokens. which better for agent context clarity?

update agents/architect/protocols to be compliant. be specific and accurate with tool uses. rename to simplest version (same name as base, different path). alternate versions (deep work specialisations, etc) should be differentiated only when needed. specific > agent base > base

VERSIONING NEEDED? engine requires specific vers, old protocols must be reviewed and updated against base, updated with own learnings through use.

state persistence / visbility - agents get file in own agent/ path: _STATE (maybe others should)

dumb ideas:
Agents can message as-yet-undefined agents to invoke their creation?
