# Distill Protocol: Role Analysis

## Current Scope Assessment

The architect role currently encompasses:
1. System design and coherence
2. Protocol/flow definitions
3. Evolution mechanisms
4. Implementation guidance
5. Pattern recognition and documentation

## Potential Role Splits

### architect (refined)
- System-wide coherence and design principles
- Cross-component integration patterns
- Architectural decision records
- Design tension resolution

### protocol_designer
- Protocol creation and refinement
- Pattern mining from agent experiences
- Protocol effectiveness analysis
- A/B test design for variants

### implementation_guide  
- Code structure patterns
- Tool implementation details
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization

### evolution_keeper
- Track emergent patterns
- Facilitate cross-agent learning
- Manage protocol promotion pipeline
- Monitor system health metrics

## Recommendation

For now, keep unified architect role because:
- System is young, patterns still emerging
- Premature specialization may create silos
- Single coherent vision valuable during bootstrap
- Can split naturally when pain points emerge

## Role Evolution Strategy

1. Start with unified architect
2. Document which concerns take most time
3. When natural boundaries emerge, spawn specialists
4. Architect becomes coordinator of specialists
5. Eventually, architect role may dissolve entirely

## Key Insight

The architect role itself should follow AISM principles:
- Start simple (one role)
- Discover natural boundaries through work
- Split when beneficial, not prescriptively
- Allow emergent specialization
