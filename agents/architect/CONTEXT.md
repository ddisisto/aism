# Current Context

## Session Insights

### Core Architecture Decisions (Locked In)
- **Tool Interface**: CLI via Redis message bus
- **State Management**: Redis for live ops, filesystem for persistence
- **Container Pattern**: Engine prompts, agent acts autonomously
- **Protocol/Flow Split**: Protocols = single state behaviors, Flows = multi-state patterns

### Recurring Themes
1. **Simplicity First**: Every design choice should reduce complexity
2. **Agent Autonomy**: Agents decide how to achieve goals within state constraints
3. **Living Patterns**: Protocols evolve through use, not committee design
4. **Measurement Philosophy**: Observe everything, interfere with nothing
5. **Emergent Specialization**: Let agents discover their strengths

### Key Tensions Resolved
- Control vs Autonomy → Engine validates, agents execute
- Speed vs Durability → Redis for ops, filesystem for audit
- Prescription vs Discovery → Base protocols minimal, variants emergent
- Individual vs Collective → Personal adaptations can become shared patterns

### Current State
- Core architecture designed and documented
- Protocols/flows conceptually separated  
- Evolution mechanisms outlined
- Ready to implement bootstrap and base protocols

### Next Critical Steps
1. Test agent container boot process (manual Docker run)
2. Test stdin/stdout IO between architect and containerized agent
3. Design state serialization format for agent live view
4. Implement minimal aism tool (Redis communication)
5. Create base work protocols (inbox, deep_work, distill)
6. Build engine with Redis integration

### Session Learnings
- No time estimates in protocols (use token estimates when learned)
- No @ symbols in paths or agent names (save for inter-agent messaging)
- Embrace agent nature rather than imposing external patterns
